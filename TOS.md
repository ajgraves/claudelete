# Claudelete Terms of Service
**Last Updated: January 9, 2026**

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Claudelete (the “Bot”), a Discord bot that provides timed auto-deletion of messages and threads, manual purge commands, and related moderation utilities.

**By inviting Claudelete to your Discord server, using any of its commands, configuring it, or otherwise interacting with it, you agree to these Terms.** If you do not agree, do not add or use the Bot.

If you are adding the Bot on behalf of a Discord server/community, you represent that you have the authority to bind that server and its members to these Terms.

## 1. Acceptance & Eligibility
You must comply with Discord's Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, Developer Terms of Service, and Developer Policy at all times.

The Bot is not intended for users under 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your country to use Discord). By using the Bot, you confirm you meet this requirement.

## 2. Permitted Use & Prohibited Conduct
The Bot is provided for legitimate server moderation and cleanup purposes only.

You agree not to:
* Use the Bot for spam, harassment, raids, illegal activities, **mass-deletion intended to harass or disrupt**, or any violation of Discord policies
* Attempt to abuse, overload, circumvent rate limits, or reverse-engineer the Bot
* Use manual purge commands to target users or content in ways that violate Discord rules or applicable laws

**We reserve the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate the Bot's access to any server or user (including blacklisting the server/guild owner) at our sole discretion, with or without notice, if we believe (in our reasonable judgment) that the server or its use of the Bot poses a risk to the Bot, its developer, other users, or violates these Terms, Discord's policies, or applicable law.**

## 3. Bot Functionality & No Guarantees
Claudelete offers per-channel timed auto-deletion of messages, auto-deletion of orphaned threads, and manual purge commands (e.g., by user or channel).

All features require the Bot to have the following Discord permissions in the relevant channels/servers: **View Channel, Manage Messages, Manage Threads, and Read Message History.**

The Bot is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee:
* 100% uptime, error-free operation, or successful deletion (Discord API limits apply, e.g., bulk delete only works on messages under 14 days old)
* Prevention of all unwanted messages/threads
* Recovery of deleted content (the Bot never logs or stores message content for recovery)

You are solely responsible for proper configuration and ensuring the Bot has required permissions.

## 4. Data Collection & Privacy
Claudelete is designed to collect the **minimum data necessary** to function and for limited internal metrics.

### **What we collect and store (in a secure database):**
* Guild (server) ID and name
* Channel IDs and names configured for auto-deletion/management
* Guild owner user ID and name (for contact in case of issues)
* Total member count per guild (internal metric only, not used for profiling or shared)
* Logs of actions taken (e.g., “attempted to delete message ID X in channel Y”, “purged messages from user ID Z”) — never includes message content, attachments, or text

### **We do NOT collect, store, or log:**
* Any message content, text, attachments, embeds, or media
* User messages for display, recovery, or auditing beyond numeric IDs in failure logs

**Usage of data:** Strictly for Bot operation (applying configurations), troubleshooting (logs), and anonymous aggregate metrics (e.g., “how many users are protected”).

Data is **never** sold, rented, shared with third parties for marketing, or used for training AI/ML models. We may share data only if: (a) required by law, (b) to comply with Discord requests, or (c) to protect the security/integrity of the Bot.

When a server removes the Bot, associated configuration data is typically deleted (though backups may persist briefly for recovery).

For data access/deletion requests (e.g., under GDPR/CCPA), contact the developer (details below). We will handle valid requests promptly where feasible.

This section serves as the Bot's **Privacy Policy** as required by Discord's Developer Terms.

## 5. Limitation of Liability & No Warranties
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for any damages (direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or otherwise) arising from:
* Use or inability to use the Bot
* Deleted messages, failed deletions, or disputes over deletions
* Server disruptions, data loss, or interactions with Discord

The Bot is provided without warranties of any kind (express or implied), including fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or reliability.

## 6. Enforcement, Suspension, and Termination of Access
We may, at any time and in our sole discretion:
* Suspend or terminate the Bot's functionality in your server
* Blacklist your server (prevent re-invitation or remove existing instance)
* Blacklist or ban individual users (including server owners) from using or interacting with the Bot across any servers

Common reasons for such actions may include (but are not limited to):
* Violation of these Terms
* Violation of Discord's Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, Developer Terms of Service, or Developer Policy
* Use of the Bot in a manner that facilitates spam, raids, harassment, illegal activities, or other harmful conduct
* Abuse of Bot features (e.g., excessive or malicious use of purge commands)
* Any conduct that, in our judgment, endangers the security, integrity, or operation of the Bot
* Repeated or severe disregard for configuration best practices that leads to Bot instability or complaints

Such actions may be taken without prior warning or explanation, though we may (at our option) provide notice via DM to the server owner or through the support server.

Decisions regarding enforcement are final and not subject to appeal unless we choose to offer one on a case-by-case basis.

## 7. Changes, Suspension, Termination
We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use after changes (with notice via support server or bot announcement where practical) means acceptance.

We may modify, suspend, or terminate the Bot or your server's access at any time, for any reason (including suspected abuse), without liability. **This includes the right to permanently blacklist servers or owners from re-adding or using Claudelete.**

## 7. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Nebraska, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Sarpy County, Nebraska.

## 8. Contact & Support
For questions, data requests, or concerns:
* Join the official support Discord server: https://discord.gg/EMuWEqjbef
* Or use GitHub issues in the repository where this document is published

**By using Claudelete, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms (including the integrated Privacy Policy).**
